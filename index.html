    <h1>Purple Chen's Profile</h1>
    <div class="autobio"> 
    
      <p class="bio"> My  name  is  Purple  Chen, and  I'm  a  graduate  of  National  Tsing  Hua  University  majoring  in  Economics.  The  reason  I  called  Purple  is  that  it  is  red  mix  blue.  Red  represents  my  passion  and  strong  ambition  for  improvement,  and  blue  is  my  self-expectation  for  learning.  Besides,  My  mentors  and  friends  always  describe  me  as  initiative  and  outgoing.  In  the  past  3  years,  I  worked  as  M17  Entertainment,  so  called  17Live-  streaming,  Head  of  global  expansion.  I  helped  over  5  countries  to  achieve  aggressive  revenue  goals,  and  also  assisted  US  market  launch.  Furthermore,  I  was  international  marketing  asst.  Manager,  helping  each  region  to  set  up  digital  ads  optimization  workflow  to  lower  the  cost.    

I  was  previously  a  marketing  intern  at  PHILIPS.  We  got  chance  to  execute  our  team’s  plans  in  channels.  I  found  myself  desired  to  listen  and  talk  to  customers  to  understand  their  needs.  Luckily,  our  team  got  championship  for  having  an  outstanding  performance.  Also,  I  was  a  marketing  and  PR  intern  at  VMFIVE,  a  Taiwanese  Startup  specializing  in  interactive  Ads.  I  learnt  how  to  pitch  our  product  within  a  short  time  grabbing  everyone's  attention.  In  addition,  I  was  in  charge  of  four  languages  media  kit,  which  was  for  press  and  people  who  are  interested  in  our  company.  Through  these  experiences,  I’ve  gained  communication,  customer  service,  and  marketing  planning  skills.</p>
